# Part 1 - Design and set-up of true experiment

## The motivation for the planned research

During this century we have seen the rise of powerful search engines, which are able to quickly provide you with links to the data you are trying to find. A recent development in this field is the introduction of large language models (LLMs). These LLMs have the capability to present the search results in a more natural and human-friendly way. The hype around these models has led large search engines to quickly incorporate these LLMs in their products. An example is Bing, which has incorporated a version of chatGPT into their search browser. The question that remains is if this integration actually leads to an increase in perceived user experience or if the enthusiasm is purely based on the current hype. By conducting the experiments described below, the goal is to find out if the chatGPT integration in the Bing search engine improves the user experience.

## The theory underlying the research

(Max 200 words) Preferable based on theories reported in literature

## Research questions

Does the integration of chatGPT into the Bing search engine lead to an increase in user experience over the Bing search engine without this integration?

## The related conceptual model

<<<<<<< HEAD
![image1](CM_chatgpt.png)
=======
Independent variable: Search Mode - categorial variable - ChatGPT, standard Dependent variable: user experiences Mediating variable: (at least 1): session length, relevance of results Moderating variable: (at least 1): Experience with chatbots
>>>>>>> e6f81701572c31604df18fc49f53fcdde20b5718

## Experimental Design

Hypothesis: the integration of chatGPT has a positive effect on user experience during search.

Design: we use a within-subject experiment. All the participants both evaluate the standard search engine and the search engine with chatGPT integration. Because we only have one group, random allocation is not an issue. First each participant gets a set of questions to which they should find the answer using the regular Bing search engine. Then, the user experience is evaluated using a questionnaire. Afterwards, the participant is again presented with a new set of questions to which they should find the answers using the search engine with the chatGPT integration. The user experience is again evaluated using a questionnaire. To make sure that the type of questions are equally hard between the two search experiments, we randomly select half of the total number of questions for each of the experiments.

## Experimental procedure

A room is prepared with a laptop with two search engines in it: search engine 1 is a standard version of Bing, search engine 2 is Bing with Chat-GPT integration. Each participant is called into the room and is given a set of questions to answer or find information for. The participant uses the Bing search engine to find information for those questions. Afterwards the user is given a questionnaire to answer. Then, the participant is given a new set of questions and uses the Bing with Chat-GPT engine after which he/she is given the same questionnaire again. Break up order of questions.

![image](experiment_precedure.png)


## Measures

We use a questionnaire that should give us an indication of the perceived user experience of the participants for both the normal search engine and the chatGPT integrated search engine. The questionnaire consists of a list of statements, where the participants have to fill in whether they agree with a certain statement. The focus of this questionnaire is on the overall user satisfaction, not on the specific results that the search engines return. The answers are based on an interval Likert-scale from 1 to 7. Where a higher number corresponds to a higher agreement with the statement. The answers to the statements are collected and can be compared between the two experiment rounds (with and without chatGPT). The Likert-scale answers allow us to make a clear numerical comparison, which finally is our measure for the experiment.

## Participants

We want to find a group of participants in Delft as diverse as possible, because we want to find the general user experience improvement. If we only take a subsample of the population, like elderly people or students, we do not get a very general idea and loose external validity. We need 119 people, because we use a Likert scale using intervals. This provides us with a 95% confidence interval. We find participants by calling people in Delft and asking if they want to participate in our experiment, after which the experiment is conducted some other moment. This way we hope to get a random sample from the whole population in Delft.

## Suggested statistical analyses

We want to find the difference between the user experience to see if it has increased. This means that the results of the two experiments have to be paired with each other. The results of the two experiments are dependent, because a participant maybe in general already gives higher ratings. So this means that with our interval questions, we could use a paired sample t-test or repeated measure ANOVA.

# Part 2 - Generalized linear models

## Question 1 Twitter sentiment analysis (Between groups - single factor)

### Conceptual model

![](images/concep_model_tweets.PNG)

### Model description

The model that we fit on the data is normal distribution where the mean is dependent on the individual that tweeted the tweet. This way a new mean is created for each individual. So we have the following equations:

$score \sim dnorm(mu, sigma)$

$mu <- a[Candidate]$

$a[Candidate] \sim dnorm(0, 10)$

$sigma \sim dunif(0.001, 20)$

The priors defined here are loosely based on the visual inspection of the data, which is given below. In these graphs we can see that the sentiment of the tweets for each individual are centered around 0. So we take a distribution for the mean of our model that also has a mean of 0, but we add a standard deviation of 10 to be sure that the actual mean is found. For the sigma of our model, we also choose quite an uninformed prior. It seems that the data has a standard deviation at most 5, but to be sure that it is contained within our prior, we extend it to 20.

### Generate Synthetic data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(twitteR)
#install.packages("RCurl", dependencies = T)
library(RCurl)
#install.packages("bitops", dependencies = T)
library(bitops)
#install.packages("plyr", dependencies = T)
library(plyr)
#install.packages('stringr', dependencies = T)
library(stringr)
#install.packages("NLP", dependencies = T)
library(NLP)
#install.packages("tm", dependencies = T)
library(tm)
#install.packages("wordcloud", dependencies=T)
#install.packages("RColorBrewer", dependencies=TRUE)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(wordcloud)
#install.packages("reshape", dependencies=T)
library(reshape)
```

Below the code is given for the creation of the synthetic data. We pick three normal distributions, where each distribution has a different mean, but the same standard deviation (sd=2). The three distributions have a mean of -5, 0 and 5 for T, C and B respectively.

```{r}
# Synthesis of a test data set.
sequence <- seq(-10, 10, by = .1)
test_T = rnorm(sequence, mean=-5, sd=2)
test_C = rnorm(sequence, mean=0, sd=2)
test_B = rnorm(sequence, mean=5, sd=2)

sem_test<-data.frame(test_T, test_C, test_B)

semFrameTest <-melt(sem_test, measured=c(test_T, test_C, test_B))
names(semFrameTest) <- c("Candidate", "score")
semFrameTest$Candidate <-factor(semFrameTest$Candidate, labels=c("Donald Trump",
                                        "Hillary Clinton", "Bernie Sanders"))
```

### Visual inspection Mean and distribution sentiments
<<<<<<< HEAD
To get an idea of the distributions of the data, we make some graphs. First, we plot the data distributions of the tweet sentiment per individual. This graph shows that the distributions seem similar, all with a mean around 0. However, for the Trump data, there seem to be more more values with a higher sentiment. If we look at the boxplots, we see that Trump seems to have the most positive sentiment, but he also has more extreme maximum. Hillary seems to be a bit less positive than Bernie.

### Frequentist approach

#### Analysis verification

If we input the synthetic data into the model, we see that the individuals are indeed significant for the sentiment we get out of the tweet. This is what we expected, since this is how we created the data. A summary of the model reveals that the means of the groups in the model are indeed the means that we set of the distribution. This can be seen in the coefficient section below. The synthetic Trump data has an estimate around -5, Hillary close to 0 and Bernie close to 5. These are exactly the parameters that we gave the synthetic data. The p-value with a factor of 10\*\*-16 is way lower than the needed 0.05, which shows us that the individuals have a significant effect on the resulting sentiment. The F-value of 1243 shows us that the variation between sample means is way larger than the variance within samples. This again shows that there is a big difference between the individuals. Finally, the AIC value comparison shows that model1 has a better fit of the data than model0, since its AIC value is lower.

```{r}
#include your analysis code of synthetic data and output in the document

# model without predictor
model0 <- lm(semFrameTest$score ~ 1, data = semFrameTest)

# model with predictor
model1 <- lm(semFrameTest$score ~ semFrameTest$Candidate, data = semFrameTest) 
anova(model0, model1)
summary(model1)

AIC(model0, model1)
```

#### Linear model {#linear-model}

If we input the actual data into the model, we see that the individuals are indeed significant for the sentiment we get out of the tweet. This can be concluded by looking at the p and F-value. The p-value is way lower than 0.05, which shows us that the individuals have a significant effect on the resulting sentiment. The F-value of 13.478 shows us that the variation between sample means is way larger than the variance within samples. This again shows that there is a difference between the individuals, regarding tweet sentiment. The AIC values show us that model1 has a better fit, since its its AIC value is lower than model0.

```{r}
#include your analysis code and output in the document

# model without predictor
model0 <- lm(semFrame$score ~ 1, data = semFrame)

# model with predictor
model1 <- lm(semFrame$score ~ semFrame$Candidate, data = semFrame)

anova(model0, model1)
summary(model1)

AIC(model0, model1)
```

#### Post Hoc analysis

If we conduct a bonferroni post hoc analysis, we see that Donald Trump has a significant difference with both Hillary and Bernie, regarding tweet sentiment. However, we also see that the tweet sentiment difference of Bernie and Hillary is not significant.

The results of the normality tests show us that the spread of tweet sentiments per individual can indeed be seen as a normal distribution. This confirms the normality assumption.

The results of the levene test show that we can indeed assume the individual normal distributions to have the same variance.

So the post-hoc analysis shows that our assumptions of the data could indeed be made.

```{r}
#include your code and output in the document
pairwise.t.test(semFrame$score, semFrame$Candidate,
paired = FALSE, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")

library(car)
tapply(semFrame$score, semFrame$Candidate, shapiro.test)
leveneTest(semFrame$score, semFrame$Candidate)
```

#### Report section for a scientific publication

The analysis focuses on the effect of an individual on the sentiment of their tweets. In the experiment, two models are created. The first model only has an intercept and no additional information about the individual that tweeted the tweet. The second model does have this information. The experiment has shown that the addition of data about the individual significantly improves the model (F=13.478, Pr(\>F)\<0.001).

Moreover, a post-hoc analysis of the experiment was conducted. This showed that the sentiment differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton (p\<0.001) and Bernie Sanders (p\<0.001) were significant. However, the sentiment difference between Hillary and Bernie (p=1) was not significant. The post-hoc analysis also showed that the model assumptions regarding normality and equal variances could be made. The Shapiro-Wilk normality tests showed that for both Trump (W = 0.85938, p-value \< 0.001), Hillary (W = 0.91847, p-value \< 0.001) and Bernie (W = 0.92669, p-value \< 0.001) the distributions can be regarded as normal distributions. Finally, Levene's test for homogeneity of variances showed that all distributions indeed have equal variances (F=14.217, Pr(\>F)\<0.001).

### Bayesian Approach

#### Analysis verification

We fit two models, a model with only an intercept and a model with the relation between sentiment and individual added. The second model has a better fit, since its WAIC value is lower than the model without the additional relation.

We can see that the means of the synthetic data are correctly reproduced by the second model. a[1], a[2] and a[3] correspond to the synthetic Trump, Hillary and Bernie data, respectively. Also the sigma of 1.98 is almost a precise reproduction of the actual standard deviation of 2. For a[1], a[2] and a[3] the 95% credible intervals are [-5.18,-4.63], [-0.51,0.05] and [4.66,5.21], respectively.

The WAIC values show that m1 has a better fit, since its WAIC value is lower than model0.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(rethinking)
```

```{r}
#include your analysis code of synthetic data and output in the document
da <- subset(semFrameTest, select = c(score, Candidate))
m0 <-map2stan(
  alist(
    score ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a,
    a ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    sigma ~ dunif(0.001, 20)
  ), data = da, iter = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4
)
m1 <-map2stan(
  alist(
    score ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a[Candidate] ,
    a[Candidate] ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    sigma ~ dunif(0.001, 20)
  ), data = da, iter = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4
)
precis(m1, depth = 2, prob = .95)
compare(m0, m1)
```

#### Model comparison

Again we make two models, one with only intercept and one with an additional relation to the individual. The WAIC shows that the model with the additional relation is better than the model with only intercept. The 95% credible intervals are [0.74,1.34] for Trump, [-0.32,0.29] for Hillary and [-0.14,0.48] for Bernie. It shows that there is no overlap between Trump and any other in the credible intervals, but there is some overlap between Hillary and Bernie.

The WAIC values show that m1 has a better fit, since its WAIC value is lower than model0.

```{r}
#include your code and output in the document
dat <- subset(semFrame, select = c(score, Candidate))
m0 <-map2stan(
  alist(
    score ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a ,
    a ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    sigma ~ dunif(0.001, 20)
  ), data = dat, iter = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4
)
m1 <-map2stan(
  alist(
    score ~ dnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a[Candidate] ,
    a[Candidate] ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    sigma ~ dunif(0.001, 20)
  ), data = dat, iter = 1000, chains = 4, cores = 4
)
precis(m1, depth = 2, prob = .95)
compare(m0, m1)
```

#### Comparison individual/organisation pair

We compare the three possible pairs, and we see basically the same results as in the frequentist approach. The 95% credible intervals with Trump both do not include 0, which makes it likely that the tweet sentiments of the others are not equal to those of Trump. We can also see that the 95% credible interval of Hillary and Bernie does contain 0, which still maintains the possibility that there is not a difference in tweet sentiments between these two individuals.

```{r}
#include your code and output in the document
post <- extract.samples(m1, n=1e5)
diffhill_trump <- post$a[,1] - post$a[,2]
diffhill_bernie <- post$a[,2] - post$a[,3]
difftrump_bernie <- post$a[,1] - post$a[,3]
PI(diffhill_trump, prob = 0.95 )
PI(diffhill_bernie, prob = 0.95 )
PI(difftrump_bernie, prob = 0.95 )
```

## Question 2 - Website visits (between groups - Two factors)

### Conceptual model

Make a conceptual model underlying this research question

![](images/CM.jpg)

### Specific Mathematical model

Describe the mathematical model that you fit on the data. Take for this the complete model that you fit on the data. Also, explain your selection for the priors. Assume Gaussian distribution for the number of page visits.

<<<<<<< HEAD


The model can expressed as follows:

pages ~ Norm(mu, sigma)

mu = Beta0 + Beta1 * version + Beta2 * portal + Beta3 * version * portal

Beta0  ~ dnorm(20, 10)

c(Beta1, Beta2, Beta3) ~ dnorm(10,10)

sigma ~ dunif(0.001, 40)
=======
I adopt linear regression model o fit the data, which can be expressed as follows:

y = $\beta_0$ + $\beta_1$ \* version + $\beta_2$ \* portal + $\beta_3$ \* version \* portal + $\epsilon$

-   y represents the number of page visits, which is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution.
-   version is a binary variable (0 for the old version, 1 for the new version) indicating the website version.
-   portal is a binary variable (0 for consumers, 1 for companies) indicating the web portal entry.
-   version \* portal represents the interaction term between the website version and portal.
-   $\beta_0$ is intercept and $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$ are the coefficients for the three terms. I adopt Cauchy distribution for them assuming weakly informative prior, which has a large scale value has a gentle slope, letting data in the more extreme region still be of influence if the likelihood is strong here
-   $\epsilon$ represents the error term, assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, $\epsilon ~ Normal(0, \sigma)$.
>>>>>>> e6f81701572c31604df18fc49f53fcdde20b5718



The model assumes a Gaussian distribution for the number of page visits, with relatively uninformed priors assigned to the intercept and coefficients (Beta0, Beta1, Beta2, Beta3) as well as the standard deviation (sigma). The interaction term (version * portal) captures the combined effect of the website version and portal. To account for uncertainty, a weakly informative prior is chosen for sigma using a uniform distribution with a range that encompasses a broad yet plausible set of values.
### Create Synthetic data

Create a synthetic data set with a clear interaction effect between the two factors for verifying your analysis later on. Report the values of the coefficients of the linear model used to generate synthetic data.

```{r}
#include your code for generating the synthetic data

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Specify the sample size
n <- 100

# Create the independent variables
version <- rep(c(0, 1), each = n/2)
portal <- rep(c(0, 1), times = n/2)

# Generate the interaction effect
interaction <- version * portal

# the values of the coefficients of the linear model
beta0 <- 2.5     # Intercept
beta1 <- 1.5     # Coefficient for version
beta2 <- 0.8     # Coefficient for portal
beta3 <- 0.7     # Coefficient for interaction

# Generate the dependent variable (number of page visits)
<<<<<<< HEAD
pages <- beta0 + beta1 * version + beta2 * portal + beta3 * interaction + rnorm(n,0,1)
=======
page_visits <- beta0+beta1*version+beta2*portal+beta3*interaction+rnorm(n)
>>>>>>> e6f81701572c31604df18fc49f53fcdde20b5718

# Combine the variables into a data frame
fake_data <- data.frame(version, portal, interaction, pages)

# View the first few rows of the synthetic data set
head(fake_data)

```

### Visual inspection

Graphically examine the mean page visits for the four different conditions. Give a short explanation of the figure.

```{r}
#include your code and output in the document

# Load the required library
library(ggplot2)

web_data <- read.csv("data/webvisit0.csv") 
web_data$version <- factor(web_data$version, levels = c(0:1), labels = c("Old","New"))
web_data$portal <- factor(web_data$portal, levels = c(0:1), labels = c("Consumers","Companies"))

bar <- ggplot(web_data, aes(version , pages, fill = portal))
bar + stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "bar", position="dodge")
# 
# box <- ggplot(web_data, aes(version, pages, fill = portal))
# box + geom_boxplot()

<<<<<<< HEAD
```
=======
![](images/visual_inspection_2.jpg)
>>>>>>> e6f81701572c31604df18fc49f53fcdde20b5718

The figure shows the mean page visits obtained in four conditions. The analysis revealed that the combination of the new version and web portal for companies resulted in a highest number of page visits. Furthermore, regardless of the website version, the portal for companies showed a higher number of page visits compared to the portal for consumers. Additionally, irrespective of the portal, the old version exhibited fewer page visits compared to the new version. Last, large difference between the portals for consumers and companies exist in both the new and old version conditions.

### Frequentist Approach

#### Model verification

Verify your model analysis with synthetic data and show that it can reproduce the coefficients of the linear model that you used to generate the synthetic data set. Provide a short interpretation of the results, with a reflection of AICc, F-value, p-value etc.

```{r}
#include your analysis code of synthetic data and output in the document

library(pander) #for rendering output
library(AICcmodavg) #aictab

# Fit the linear regression model
model0 <- lm(pages ~ 1, data = fake_data, na.action = na.exclude)
model1 <- lm(pages ~ version, data = fake_data, na.action = na.exclude)
model2 <- lm(pages ~ portal, data = fake_data, na.action = na.exclude)
model3 <- lm(pages ~ version + portal, data = fake_data, na.action = na.exclude)
model4 <- lm(pages ~ version + portal + version:portal, data = fake_data, na.action = na.exclude)

# see the values of coeffients
summary(model0)
summary(model1)
summary(model2)
summary(model3)
summary(model4)


# compare the models with each other.
pander(anova(model0,model1), caption = "version as main effect on page visits")
pander(anova(model0,model2), caption = "portal as main effect on page visits")
pander(anova(model3,model4), caption = "Interation effect on top of two main effects")
pander(anova(model4), caption = "Effect of version, portal and interaction effect on page visits")


models <-list(model0, model1, model2, model3, model4)
model.names <-c("model0","model1","model2","model3","model4")
aictab(cand.set = models, modnames=model.names)


<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
#interpretation
#1. All coefficients are comparable to original values and statistically 
#significant.
#2. The p-value is reported as "< 2.2e-16", which is essentially zero. This 
#extremely low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis,
#suggesting that the predictors collectively have a significant effect on the 
#outcome variable (page visits).
#3. The AICc value of 270.3466 suggests that the fitted linear regression model 
#has a relatively good fit to the data compared to alternative models.
>>>>>>> e6f81701572c31604df18fc49f53fcdde20b5718
```
The results indicate that the website version, portal, and their interaction effect have a significant impact on the number of page visits (p < 0.01). Model 4, which includes the interaction effect, demonstrates the best goodness-of-fit with the smallest AICc value. The reproduced coefficients in Model 4 closely align with the original ones, further supporting its superiority over the other models.


#### Model analysis with Gaussian distribution assumed

Redo the analysis now on the real data set. Assume Gaussian distribution for the number of page visits. Provide a short interpretation of the results, with an interpretation of AICc, F-value, p-value, etc.

The results indicate that the website version, portal, and their interaction effect have a significant impact on the number of page visits (p < 0.01). Model 4, which includes the interaction effect, demonstrates the best goodness-of-fit with the smallest AICc value. 
#### Assumption analysis

Redo the analysis on the real tweet data set.  This time assume a Poisson distribution for the number of page visits. For the best fitting models (Gaussian and Poisson), examine graphically the distribution of the residuals for the model that assumes Gaussian distribution and the model that assumes Poisson distribution. Give a brief interpretation of Poisson and Gaussian distribution assumptions.

The "Residuals vs. Fitted" and "Scale-Location" plots indicate that the spread of residuals in the Gaussian model increases as the fitted values change, suggesting a violation of the Gaussian assumption. However, for the Poisson model, the spread of residuals remains relatively constant, indicating that the Poisson assumption holds true and it is more suitable to assume a poisson distribution for page visits.

The analysis investigated the interaction effect between two variables, version and portal, by dividing the data into two groups. The results indicate significant differences (p < 0.01) in the number of page visits based on the version type for both company and consumer portals. Additionally, the portal variable also has a significant impact (p < 0.01) on page visits for both the old and new versions of the website. Furthermore, the contrasts for both version and portal variables are also statistically significant (p < 0.01).

<<<<<<< HEAD
A linear model was fitted to analyze the number of page visits on a website, considering the website version and portal as independent variables, with a two-way interaction. The results indicated significant main effects for both the version (F(1, 996) = 563, p < 0.01) and the portal (F(1, 996) = 6886, p < 0.01). Furthermore, a significant two-way interaction effect was observed (F(1, 996) = 1882, p < 0.01). Further analysis of the interaction revealed a significant difference (p < 0.01) in page visits based on the website portal for old/new website version. Additionally,  the website version also has a significant impact (p < 0.01) on page visits for both the companies and consumers portals.

The model_bay_web4, which incorporates the combination of version, portal, and the interaction effect, demonstrates the lowest WAIC value, indicating superior out-of-sample fit compared to the other models evaluated. The inclusion of both web portal and the interaction effect results in a substantial decrease in the WAIC, suggesting the significance of these two factors in explaining the observed data. Furthermore, the credible intervals for all coefficients encompass their values when using a linear function, indicating that the estimated coefficients are statistically consistent.

# Part 3 - Multilevel model

## Visual inspection

Use graphics to inspect the distribution of the score, and relationship between session and score. Give a short description of the figure.

```{r}
#include your code and output in the document
library(sm)
library(car)

set0 <- read.csv("data/set1.csv")
#stem leaf plot is useless in this case
#stem(set1$score, atom = 1e-04)

hist(set0$score, xlab="scores", main="score frequencies histogram")
hist(set0$session, xlab="sessions", main="session frequencies histogram")

# Define color gradient
color_range <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "red"))

# Assign colors based on session number
color_vector_temp <- color_range(length(unique(set0$session)))
color_vector <- color_vector_temp[as.numeric(unique(set0$session))]
lty_vector <- rep(1, each=length(unique(set0$session)))

note_text <- "17"



den <- sm.density.compare(set0$score, group = set0$session, h=2.5,
                          col= color_vector, lty=lty_vector)
title(main="score density by session")
#text(x=0, labels ="17", adj=c(-16,-18))

legend("topleft", den$levels, lty=den$lty, lwd=den$lwd, y.intersp=1, ncol=3,
       col=den$col, title="session number")
boxplot(score ~ session, data=set0)
#boxplot(session ~ score, data=set0)
scatterplot(score ~ session, data=set0)

```

the first two histograms are used to understand the distribution of the dependent and independent variables. the score approximately seemed to follow a normal distribution whereas the session index seem to contain less participants as it increases, by the 17th session there's only one participant.

The third graph offer a visual inspection of the distribution of scores by session number which follows a color range from blue to red. This makes it easy to see that as the score increases the color shifts from blue to red which indicates that later sessions get higher scores.

Then I plot a box plot and a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between score and session index and indeed there seem to be a pretty clear positive effect that the session index as on the score.

## Frequentist approach

### Multilevel analysis

Conduct multilevel analysis and calculate 95% confidence intervals thereby assuming a Gaussian distribution for the scores, determine:

-   If session has an impact on people score
-   If there is significant variance between the participants in their score

```{r}
library(nlme)
library(pander)
ctrl <- lmeControl(opt='optim');

freq_m1 <- lme(score ~ 1,
          data = set0,
          random = ~ 1 | subject,
          method="ML",
          control=ctrl
          )

freq_m2 <- lme(score ~ session,
          data = set0,
          random = ~ 1 | subject,
          method="ML",
          control=ctrl
          )

sm1 <- summary(freq_m1)
sm2 <- summary(freq_m2)
pander(sm1$tTable)
pander(sm2$tTable)

#print(sm2)
pander(anova(freq_m1, freq_m2))

#include your code and output in the document
```

The first model only finds a fixed intercept with value 19.8 but no slope.The second model, which is a bit more complicated, takes into account the effect that session has on the score and found a slope of 0.991 and the intercept now became 13.17. the second model is able to perform much better than the first one as indicated by the AIC scores: 939.2, 1660 respectively.

### Report section for a scientific publication

we constructed a multi-level regression model and the experiment showed a significant association between the session number and the score obtained with t(260, N=284)=15.48, p\<0.0001 for the intercept of value 13.19 and t(260, N=284)=15.48, p\<0.0001 for the slope of value 0.99.

the relationship between sessions and scores show significant variance across subjects in the intercept SD=4.03 (95% CI: 2.99, 5.41) and in the slope SD=0.04 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.12) and the slopes and intercepts were negatively significantly correlated, cor=-.81.

## Bayesian approach

### Model description

The most complete model to predict subjects' scores assumes that the scores are Gaussian distributed. The mean, or expected value, of the score is then modeled through a linear function which depends on: a fixed intercept $a$ modeled with a normal prior. A varying intercept $a_{subject}$ with an adaptive prior, used to explain the variation of the intercept between subjects. a fixed coefficient $b$ which is the slope that explains the session effect on the score. a varying coefficient $b_{subject}$ with a fixed prior, used to explain the variation of the slope for different subjects.

The prior values, Are chosen based on the previous visual inspection of the mean and previous intercepts and coefficient values from the frequentist models.

$score \sim Norm(\mu, \sigma) \ \ \ [likelihood]\\ \mu = a + a_{subject} + (b + b_{subject}) * session \ \ \ \ [linear \ model]\\ a_{subject} = Norm(0, a_\sigma) \ \ \ \ \ [adaptive \ prior]\\ a_\sigma = HalfCouch(0, 10) \ \ \ [hyper \ prior]\\ b_{subject} = Norm(0,10) \ \ \ \ \ \ [fixed \ prior]\\ a = Norm(15, 25) \ \ \ [fixed \ prior] \\ b = Norm(0, 50) \ \ \ \ [fixed \ prior] \\ \sigma = Norm(0, 10) \ \ \ \ [fixed \ prior]$

The first two models performed very similarly (WAIC: 1623.7, 1622.6) but the third model showed a significant improvement (WAICC: 861.2) this is due to the addition of the session intercept and slope which contains most of the score variance.

#### scientific report

we fitted a muli-level Bayesian regression model on our data and found

### Estimates examination

the fixed intercept a is 13.04 this means that in absence of subject information during session 0 the score will be 13.04.

The fixed slope is 1.27 this means that in absence of subject information the score will increase by 1.27 for every session.

a_sigma_subject is 4.41 which means that the subject specific intercept has a standard deviation of 4.41

sigma is 1 which is the standard deviation of the score.

subject 23 is the subject with the highest average score which is on average 6.20 points above the intercept whereas subject 7 has the lowest with an intercept correction of -8.79.

subject 10 has a slope correction of -0.51 which means that he/she is the subject that improved less as session went on in relative terms.

subject 7 has a slope correction of -0.11 which means that he/she is the subject that improved the most as session went on in relative terms.
